# Lesson 1. Running containers in kubernetes with pods and deployments

## 1.1 Create a new pod

> k run hello-kiamol --image kiamol/ch02-hello-kiamol --restart Never
This will create a new pod called hello-kiamol with a restart policy of never

To get the resulting yaml file:
> k run hello-kiamol --image kiamol/ch02-hello-kiamol --restart Never -o yaml --dry-run=client`

## How to wait for a condition

To wait for the result:
>k wait --for condition=Ready pod kiamol

## How to query specific information

> k get po kiamol -o json 

This will get the whole json

> k get po kiamol -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[0].ready}'

## How to port-forward

> k port-forward pod/kiamol 8080:80

Forward the localhost port 8080 to the pod port 80

## How to create a deployment

The deployment is a controller type that will manage at least one pod.

> k create deployment kiamol2 --image kiamol/ch02-hello-kiamol

Noticed how the pods will have a label app=kiamol2
They will also have a Controlled By ReplicaSet

To see the labels

> k get po kiamol-2 -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'

## How interact with labels

> k label po -l app=kiamol-2 --overwrite app=test

The label option only works if at least one label is modified
Doing this modification the deployment will understand that it has missed a pod
and it will create a new one. Hence we will have 2 pods, one bounded and one unbounded. 

## Port forward to a deployment

Same of before but its the deployment who decides which one of its pods will do the port forwarding

> k port-forward deployments/kiamol-2 8080:80


# 1.2 Defining manifests

## A deployment manifest

apiVersion: v1
kind: pod

metadata: 
  name: kiamol-3

spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: kiamol/ch2-hello-kiamol
