# Pods

A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It is the unit of deployment in Kubernetes, which represents a single instance of the application.
A Pod is a logical collection of one or more containers

- Containers within the pod are scheduled together
- They share the same network namespace so they can communicate by localhost
- Mounted volumes are accesible for all of them

The pod requires controllers for:

- Replication
- Self healing
- Fault tolerance

## Pod object configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 # API endpoint on the API server
kind: Pod # Type of object
metadata: # Object's basic information
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec: # Desired state
  containers: # One single container for the pod
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.15.11
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

An object configuration can be nested as a template of other objects

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # Object type deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec: # Desired state of this deplyment
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template: # Job templating, exactly as before
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.15.11
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
