# Pods

A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It is the unit of deployment in Kubernetes, which represents a single instance of the application.
A Pod is a logical collection of one or more containers

- Containers within the pod are scheduled together
- They share the same network namespace so they can communicate by localhost
- Mounted volumes are accesible for all of them

The pod requires controllers for:

- Replication
- Self healing
- Fault tolerance

## Pod object configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 # API endpoint on the API server
kind: Pod # Type of object
metadata: # Object's basic information
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec: # Desired state
  containers: # One single container for the pod
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.15.11
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

An object configuration can be nested as a template of other objects

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # Object type deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec: # Desired state of this deplyment
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template: # Job templating, exactly as before
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.15.11
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

# Labels

Key-value pair used by controllers to group together objects.

```
kubectl get pods -o customcolumns=NAME:metadata.name,LABELS:metadata.labels
```

Therefore, if you change a pod or a deployment label, the controller will understand that it has lost one instance:

```bash
# Add a deployment
kubectl create deployment hello-kiamol --image=kiamol/ch02-hello-kiamol
# list all Pods, showing the Pod name and labels:
kubectl get pods -o customcolumns=NAME:metadata.name,LABELS:metadata.labels
# update the "app" label for the Deploymentâ€™s Pod:
kubectl label pods -l app=hello-kiamol --overwrite app=hello-kiamol-x
# fetch Pods again:
kubectl get pods -o customcolumns=NAME:metadata.name,LABELS:metadata.labels
# update the "app" label for the the unmanaged Pod:
kubectl label pods -l app=hello-kiamol-x --overwrite app=hello-kiamol-2
# fetch the Pods again:
kubectl get pods -l app -o customcolumns=NAME:metadata.name,LABELS:metadata.labels
```

## Selectors

- Equality: env==dev
- Set based: env in (dev,qa). Suports: in, notin, exists and does not exists

# ReplicationController

- No longer recommended

Ensures a specified number of replicas of a Pod is running at any given time, by constantly comparing the actual state with the desired state of the managed application

# ReplicaSet

- New ReplicationController
- Is not recommended to use it by itself. It is better to use a Deployment
- Replica set implements replication and self-healing
- It supports equality and set-based labels selectors

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend # It will adquire any pod with the label tier == frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: php-redis
          image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
```
